# Exchange_XH

Exchange_XH facilitates exporting and importing the contents of a
CMSimple_XH website to and from XML, respectively.  This may be helpful for
the migration to or from other CMSs.
The plugin also supports importing the contents of CMSimple_XH 1.6.x
into CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0.

## Requirements

Exchange_XH is a plugin for [CMSimple_XH](https://cmsimple-xh.org/).
It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 and PHP ≥ 7.1.0 with the DOM extension.
Exchange_XH also requires [Plib_XH](https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh) ≥ 1.8;
if that is not already installed (see *Settings*→*Info*),
get the [lastest release](https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest),
and install it.

## Download

The [lastest release](https://github.com/cmb69/exchange_xh/releases/latest)
is available for download on Github.

## Installation

The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.

1. Backup the data on your server.
1. Unzip the distribution on your computer.
1. Upload the whole folder `exchange/` to your server into the `plugins/` folder
   of CMSimple_XH.
1. Set write permissions for the subfolders `css/` and `languages/`.
1. Browse to `Plugins` → `Exchange` in the back-end of the site,
   to check if all requirements are fulfilled.

## Settings

The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the back-end of the site. Browse to `Plugins` → `Exchange`.

<!-- You can change the default settings of Exchange_XH under `Config`. Hints
for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse. -->

Localization is done under `Language`. You can translate the character
strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
or customize them according to your needs.

The look of Exchange_XH can be customized under `Stylesheet`.

## Usage

You can export and import the contents of the current language in the
main administration of the plugin (`Plugins` → `Import/Export`).
After successful export you find the file `content.xml` in the
`content/` folder of the current language, right besides the
`content.htm` from which it was exported. To import foreign
contents, you have to place `content.xml` right besides the `content.htm` that you want
to be *overwritten* (so make sure you make a backup before) by
the import.

For multilingual websites, each language content has to be imported and
exported separately.

To import the contents of CMSimple_XH 1.6.x, you need to rename the old
`content.htm` to `content.1.6.htm`, and put it in the `content/` folder of
the new CMSimple_XH installation.  Then go to `Plugins` → `Import/Export`
and press the `Import` button in the `Import CMSimple_XH 1.6 contents`
section.  For multilingual websites, this needs to be done for each
language.

## Limitations

When importing old CMSimple_XH 1.6.x contents, only the most basic adjustments
are made, but the HTML headings are not changed in any way.  You may want to
do this manually after importing, so that your pages have a proper HTML heading outline.
