    Exchange_XH facilitates exporting and importing the contents of a
    CMSimple_XH website to and from XML, respectively. This may be helpful for
    the migration to or from other CMSs, and also for migrating between
    CMSimple_XH versions.

<h2>Important Notice</h2>
<p class="important">
    Exchange_XH is experminental, and particularly the exchange format may
    change. It is a so called alpha version. Use with utmost caution!
</p>
</section>

<section id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
    Exchange_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6. It requires PHP &ge;
    5.3.0 with the DOM and SimpleXML extensions.
</p>
</section>

<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
    The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
    See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
    CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="important">
    Backup the data on your server.
</li>
<li>
    Unzip the distribution on your computer.
</li>
<li>
    Upload the whole directory exchange/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
    plugins directory.
</li>
<li>
    Set write permissions for the subdirectories css/ and languages/.
</li>
<!--<li class="important">
    Switch to <em>Plugins</em>→<em>Exchange</em> in the back-end to check if
    all requirements are fulfilled.
</li>-->
</ol>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
    The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select Plugins→Exchange.
</p>
<!--<p>
    You can change the default settings of Exchange_XH under <em>Config</em>. Hints
    for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
    mouse.
</p>-->
<p>
    Localization is done under <em>Language</em>. You can translate the character
    strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
    or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
    The look of Exchange_XH can be customized under <em>Stylesheet</em>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    You can export and import the contents of the current language in the
    plugin's main administration (<em>Plugins</em>→<em>Import/Export</em>).
    After successful export you find the file <code>content.xml</code> in the
    content folder of the current language, right besides the
    <code>content.htm</code> from which it was exported. To import foreign
    contents, you have to place <code>content.xml</code>, which must have an
    appropriate format, right besides the <code>content.htm</code> that you want
    to be <em>overridden</em> (so make sure you make a backup before) by
    the import.
</p>
<p>
    For multilingual websites, each language content has to be imported and
    exported separately.
</p>
<p>
    To migrate between CMSimple_XH versions, at first the plugin has to be
    installed in the old version, and all language contents have to be exported.
    Then the plugin has to be installed in the new version, the language
    contents have to be copied to their appropriate places in the new version,
    and all language contents have to be imported.
</p>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Additional markup of page headings will silently be stripped during export.
</p>

<section id="license">
<h2>License</h2>
