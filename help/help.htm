<h1 id="exchange_xh">Exchange_XH</h1>
<p>Exchange_XH facilitates exporting and importing the contents of a CMSimple_XH website to and from XML, respectively. This may be helpful for the migration to or from other CMSs, and also for migrating between CMSimple_XH versions.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Exchange_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 and PHP ≥ 7.1.0 with the DOM and SimpleXML extensions. Exchange_XH also requires <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH</a> ≥ 1.8; if that is not already installed (see <em>Settings</em>→<em>Info</em>), get the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a>, and install it.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/exchange_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole folder <code>exchange/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> folder of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subfolders <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Browse to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Exchange</code> in the back-end of the site, to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the site. Browse to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Exchange</code>.</p>
<!-- You can change the default settings of Exchange_XH under `Config`. Hints
for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse. -->
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Exchange_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>You can export and import the contents of the current language in the main administration of the plugin (<code>Plugins</code> → <code>Import/Export</code>). After successful export you find the file <code>content.xml</code> in the <code>content/</code> folder of the current language, right besides the <code>content.htm</code> from which it was exported. To import foreign contents, you have to place <code>content.xml</code>, which must have an appropriate format, right besides the <code>content.htm</code> that you want to be <em>overwritten</em> (so make sure you make a backup before) by the import.</p>
<p>For multilingual websites, each language content has to be imported and exported separately.</p>
<p>To migrate between CMSimple_XH versions, at first the plugin has to be installed in the old version, and all language contents have to be exported. Then the plugin has to be installed in the new version, the language contents have to be copied to their appropriate places in the new version, and all language contents have to be imported.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Additional markup of page headings will silently be stripped during export.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Report bugs and ask for support either on <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/exchange_xh/issues">Github</a> or in the <a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a>.</p>
